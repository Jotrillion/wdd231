        <p>Target Audience Scenario Questions
        The target audience for BourseNetwork consists primarily of students—from high school to postgraduate levels—seeking
        financial aid for their education.
        
        Scenario 1 (Undergraduate Seeker): "I am a high school student in Ghana who wants to study Engineering in Canada next
        fall. I have a strong academic record, but my parents cannot afford international tuition. Where on BourseNetwork can I
        filter scholarships specifically for Ghanaian students pursuing STEM in North America, and what is the maximum number of
        scholarships I can save to my personal dashboard?"
        
        Scenario 2 (Postgraduate/Recommendation Focus): "I am preparing to apply for a Master's program in Public Health in the
        UK. One of the top scholarships requires three letters of recommendation. Where can I find sample recommendation letter
        formats, and does BourseNetwork offer a checklist or guide on the best way to approach professors for strong
        recommendations?"</p>   
        <p>What is the best scholarship that I can apply for?</p>
